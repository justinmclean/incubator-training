== Remarks

image::logo-training.png[float=right,width=300]

* Slides made with:
* https://training.apache.org
* Incubating project
* Written in Asciidoctor
* For sharing training material
* Slides will be available there

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Under the hood Maven+AsciiDoc+RevealJS
--

== Overview

* Typical data acquisition szenarios
* Problems with these szenarios
* Solving problems with:
** Apache PLC4X
** Apache TsFile
** Apache IoTDB
* Putting it all together

[NOTE.speaker]

== Typical szenarios

image::no-problemo.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Quickly explain the scenarios
* Point out Eclipse SDV for the mobile data collection
* Don't go into the problems, that's on the next slides.
--

== Problems with these szenarios

image::mucho-problemo.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Line width == bandwidth
* Problems come on the other slide
** We'll go into all of them on the following slides
* This slide is just for setting the stage
--

== Accessibility Problems

image::mucho-problemo-plc4x.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Accessing data on the machinery
* Overloading PLCs and Network infrastructure
* Shop-floor networks usually overloaded
** Demonstrate network and device load by the thickness of lines
* Switches configured to prioritize packets
* Digitization efforts require more data -> increase traffic
--

== Apache PLC4X

image::logo-plc4x.png[float=right,width=300]

* Unified protocol adapter
* Native protocol communication
** About 19 protocols currently
* Shared API over all protocols
* Available in multiple languages
** Java, Go, C, C#, Python (Rust)

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Now you know why I'm carrying around Toddy all the time ;-)
* Why not use MQTT or OPC-UA you ask?
* Especially given the Eclipse Milo and the SparkplugB Working-Group
--

== OPC-UA

image::opc-ua-example.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* See the size of the payload?
* That's only reading one boolean value!
--

== MQTT

image::mqtt-example.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* See the size of the payload?
* SparkplugB would add more payload
--

== Modbus-TCP

image::modbus-tcp-example.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* See the size of the payload?
--

== Using native protocols

* Using native protocols of PLCs reduces:
** Size of packets
** Load on the network
** Load on the Hardware (both sides)
** Costs, as no retrofit is required

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* OPC-UA and MQTT run as additional processes on hardware
* Native protocols cause less CPU and Memory usage
* In the IT & Production Magazine even an article on how the license costs of OPC-UA are slowing digitization progress
--

== Network Load/Availability

image::mucho-problemo-tsfile.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Cars more unconnected than connected in Germany
* Bandwidth too small
** Wireless connections
** Internet Uplink
** Also Shop-floor networks
--

== Apache TsFile

image::logo-tsfile.png[float=right,width=300]

* Storage format for IoT-data
* Aggregated data
* Highly compressed data
* Available in multiple languages
* Storage technology of Apache IoTDB

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Compression to 10% of original size lossless
* Compression to 1% of original size lossy
** Lossy means: loose accuracy after several fractional digits (Not always important if its 21.45245435454°C or just 1.4524°C)
--

== How does Apache TsFile help?

* Collecting data ON the devices
** Push instead of Pull
** Bonus: Cycle-Synchronous data
* Aggregating data on gateways
* Utilizing NB IoT bandwidth 100%
* Buffering if no connection

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Libraries for common OT Engineering tools (needs to be created)
* Pull reads lots of redundant data
* Using full size of LoRaWan packet
--

== Data Volume and Granularity

image::mucho-problemo-iotdb.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Too many apps querying the hardware
* Data replicated 1-to-1 on all levels
* Internet Uplink becomes the bottleneck
* Cloud-Storage-Costs
* Different layers need different retention and granularity
--

== Solving problems with: Apache IoTDB

image::logo-iotdb.png[float=right,width=300]

* Acting as data-hub
** Unified Namespace
** Streaming queries
** Apps subscribe to DB
* Aggregation
* Compression
* Replication
* Different retention on every level/device

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Uses compression of TsFile
* Replication with aggregation (Only forward what's needed)
* IoTDB benefits:
** IoTDB is built for tree structure such as Unified Namespace
* Example:
** Line-Level: ms granularity of all data-points with one day retention
** Department-Level: minute granularity of performance indicators (year retention)
** Factory-Level: hour granularity of the main KPIs (year retention)
** Cloud-Level: daily granularity of the main KPIs (eternal retention)
--

== Solving problems with: Apache IoTDB

* Apache IoTDB / TimechoDB won first place in any dimension in any benchmark it competed in
** benchAnt
** TPCx-IoT

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* In contrast to most other TSDBs not built up on existing solution
* Built explicitly to target the scenarios causing issues with regular solutions
** Out-of-order data
** Bursts of data (Millions per Second)
** Aggregation queries

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Wins when sorting by all categories
* Would have only lost by name, if that was sortable
--

image::benchmark-tpcx-iot.png[canvas]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* TimechoDB
** Commercial offering of IoTDB by Timecho
** Apache IoTDB with additional bells and whistles aimed at enterprise customers
* Just look at the gap between 1 and 2 and third place
** Especially Performance and Price/kIoTps
--

== Putting it all together

image::solution.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* See the thinner lines?
--

== Putting it all together

* Using TsFile-Embedded on Hardware
** PLC libraries
** No Gateways needed
** Forward data via MQTT

* Gateways using:
** TsFile to store aggregated & compressed data
** PLC4X to collect data using native protocols
** Forward data to IoTDB servers using Session-API or MQTT

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Forward with MQTT because libs are already available
* OT admins know how to handle MQTT traffic
--

== Putting it all together

* Servers based on Apache IoTDB:
** Acting as central data-hub for applications (Unified Namespace)
** Applications subscribe to changes (Push vs Pull)
** Automatically replicating to higher levels
** Automatic aggregation to higher levels

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* We're currently working on all of this
* Basic functionality in Open-Source projects
* Turnkey solutions most probably as commercial product by Timecho
--
